## Project Vision and Roadmap

### Vision

SMARTJ aims to be a comprehensive platform that empowers job seekers in the software engineering field by providing tools for interview practice and streamlined job searching. Our goal is to enhance the job-seeking experience and improve candidates' chances of success in their career pursuits.

### Roadmap

#### Current Release (A1)

Our initial release focuses on establishing the core functionality of SMARTJ:

1. Interactive interview practice sessions

   - Customizable formats
   - Access to a diverse question bank
   - Video recording and written response options

2. Job Finder feature

   - Curated links to software engineering job listings
   - Pre-filtered results from various job-seeking websites

3. Basic user interface and navigation

#### Future Plans (A2 and beyond)

In upcoming releases, we plan to expand SMARTJ's capabilities:

1. User Accounts and Profiles

   - Personalized user profiles
   - Progress tracking and performance analytics

2. Video Storage

   - Ability to save recorded video responses to user accounts

3. Feedback System
   - Self-Reflection Tool: Leave personal feedback after watching video replays, including written notes and Likert scale ratings.
   - Feedback Review: Functionality to read feedback left for each interview question
